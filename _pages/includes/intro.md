I am a Research Scientist at the [NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center](https://www.stcenter.net/) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/), where I recently completed my Ph.D. in Earth Systems and Geoinformation Science (December 2025). My research focuses on developing advanced computational methods for air quality monitoring, with expertise in remote sensing, geospatial AI, uncertainty quantification, and spatial data fusion.

My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and practical environmental applications, particularly in calibrating low-cost air quality sensors and developing trustworthy AI/ML models for environmental decision-making. I have published 12+ papers with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vDCNltwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fsivanuhappy%2Fsivanuhappy.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at top conferences and journals.
